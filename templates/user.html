        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is William Casarin. I've started Satsbacker as a response to
        Pateron's abusive treatment of users that don't fit their perferred
        political mold. Satsbacker is open source alternative built on the
        Bitcoin Lightning network.</p>

        <p>When running Satsbacker, the users and backers are in control. No
        service provider or payment processor can shut you down. As long as you
        have server with a connection to the internet, you can get paid by
        people who support your work. </p>

        <h3>How you can help</h3> <p>I need your help building this out. I've
        started a satsbacker for satsbacker. To help make this a reality:</p>
